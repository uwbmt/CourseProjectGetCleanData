run_analysis.R
========================================================

This script works as follows:

1) copy the file in the "UCI HAR Dataset folder", i.e. the same folder as 'activity_labels.txt', 'features.txt', 'features_info.txt', and 'readme.txt'

2) run script

3) The script will generate to output files (1) 'tidy_data.txt', which is the same as submitted in part 1 of the assingment, (2) 'final_output.txt', which contains 'the average of each variable for each activity and each subject' as requested.
